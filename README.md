# Oh Gupy API

- the main goal is to be able to fecth data from an API, send to Cloud Storage, preferably in .parquet, then make a table with bigquery and then work with this data to do a dashboard using Figma and a BI tool(Looker Studio).

## Used Libraries

 - [Pandas üêº](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/index.html)
 - [Google BigQuery ‚ò±](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs)
 - [Google Cloud Storage ‚òÅÔ∏è](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs)

## Roadmap

- [X]   **Fetch Data**
- [X]   Transform into .parquet
- [X]   Send to **CloudStorage**
- [X]   Upload to **BigQuery**
- [X]   Work with **LookerStudio** and **Figma** to **design a dashboard**
- [ ]   Post **insights** and **final dashboard**

## Key Takeaways
